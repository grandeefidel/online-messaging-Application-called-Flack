Users will be able to sign into the site with a display name, create channels, as well as see and join existing channels

 When a user visits this flack application for the first time, they are  prompted to type in a display name which is being saved in the browsers local Storage. If a user closes the page and returns to your app later, the display name is remembered.

Any user should be able to create a new channel, so long as its name doesn’t conflict with the name of an existing channel.

Users can see a list of all current channels, and selecting one would allow the user to view the channel.


the user sees any messages that have already been sent in the selected channel, up to a maximum of 100 messages.
